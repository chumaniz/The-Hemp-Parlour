# Hemp E-commerce store

Simple idea for a hemp health line.
I dont know why, I am just doing it because it is silly fun.

# TODO:

1. I should have the 3 products underneath the hero section. [~30-60min]

2. I should make a products page. Acts as a catalogue. Will link on to individual product pages. [~2-3days]

2.1 Need to have shopping experience (Adding products to trolley, checking trolley, validating products@checkout, credit/debitcard validation, validation of purchase)...Some of this will require I start off with Golang and a RDBMS(MySQL)

3. Expand and polish the About Us page [~60min]

4. A blog page should be added.
